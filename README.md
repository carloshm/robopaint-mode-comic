# Spiral Paint

This module is a mode for [RoboPaint](https://github.com/evil-mad/robopaint),
the software for drawing robots, and your
[friendly painting robot kit, the WaterColorBot](http://watercolorbot.com)!
This mode gives you the ability to pick any image and have it drawn as a raster.
It will scan across the image and raise and lower the implement (pen, brush, or
  a better word than implement) based on how dark each pixel is.

As this is drawing your image the paper can warp, depending on the ink, paper,
and amount of large black areas being drawn. If this is a problem you can
add a small amount tape or slightly tacky removable glue to the bottom of
your paper to ensure it stays flat during the print.
